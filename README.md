# Walk Through Last Used Desktops

This KWin script enables users to quickly navigate through their previously used desktops using a keyboard shortcut.

It is designed as a reimplementation of a feature that was available in KDE 5 but omitted in KDE 6, providing users familiar with the older version a similar functionality in the latest environment.

# Usage

- Activate the Shortcut: The default keyboard shortcut is Meta+Tab. You can change this in the system settings under Shortcuts (KWin -> Walk Through Last Used Desktops).
- Navigating Desktops: Simply press Meta+Tab to cycle through your last used desktops. Quick successive presses will continue moving through your desktop history.
- Currently, the script has a fixed delay of 500 ms for continuation detection. If needed, you can modify this value directly in the script to suit your preferences.

This project is my first attempt at writing JavaScript and therefore far from perfect.
If you have any suggestions on how to make it better, I would be happy to hear them.
